# Personal Portfolio

Hi I'm Chandy Kozo
This is my personal portfolio, which I have created for demo purposes.

I learned using Node.js in Repl.it in my previous class with Tanay Sir
where I wrote code to create a quiz game. It gives you the final score after the quiz is over and shows the present high scores and asks you to send me a screen shot if you think you've bested the present high score. 

This is my first website which I created while I learning about Git and Github.

I made a Initial Commit after I updated the index.html with an html page layout.
