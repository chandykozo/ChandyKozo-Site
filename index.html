    <p>
        I have finished my Gradutaion in B.Tech im 2019, in Computer Science and Engineering

    <p>
        <br>My hobbies include reading Novel's </br>
        <br>My current favourite book is : The Girl Who Played With Fire.</br>
        <br>Author - Stieg Larsson
        <br>Part blistering espionage thriller, part riveting police procedural, and part piercing exposé on social injustice, this second book in the Millennium series is a masterful, endlessly satisfying novel.
    </br>
 
        <br>Mikael Blomkvist, crusading publisher of the magazine Millennium, has decided to run a story that will expose an extensive sex trafficking operation. On the eve of its publication, the two reporters responsible for the article are murdered, and the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to his friend, the troubled genius hacker Lisbeth Salander. Blomkvist, convinced of Salander’s innocence, plunges into an investigation. Meanwhile, Salander herself is drawn into a murderous game of cat and mouse, which forces her to face her dark past.</br>
